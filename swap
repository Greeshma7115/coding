Question:
Swap given two numbers and print them. (Try to do it without a temporary variable.) and return it.

Solution:
class Solution{   
public:
    pair<int, int> get(int a, int b){
        a=a+b;
        b=a-b;
        a=a-b;
        return {a,b};
    }
};

Explaination: Swap the numbers without using other variables. 
ex: a=4, b=5
if a=a+b; then a=9
So now if we subtract b from our new 'a' we will get value of original 'a', now store if in b.
Similarly subtract  new 'b' from new 'a' and store in a, our varibales are swapped.
As we are using get function, syntax t0 return the variables are return {a,b}.
