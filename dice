Question:
You are given a cubic dice with 6 faces. All the individual faces have a number printed on them. The numbers are in the range of 1 to 6, like any ordinary dice. 
You will be provided with a face of this cube, your task is to guess the number on the opposite face of the cube.

Solution:
class Solution
{
public:
    int oppositeFaceOfDice(int N)
    {
        if (N==1)
        return 6;
        else if (N==2)
        return 5;
        else if (N==3)
        return 4;
        else if (N==4)
        return 3;
        else if (N==5)
        return 2;
        else
        return 1;
    }
};

Explaination:
As we know the opposite sides of a cube , use flow control statements and compare the input with the number and return the output.
