Question:
Given the first 2 terms a1 and a2 of an Arithmetic Series.Find the nth term of the series. 

Solution:
class Solution {
  public:
    int nthTermOfAP(int a1, int a2, int n) {
        // code here
        int d=a2-a1;
        int an=0;
        an=a1+(n-1)*d;
        
        return an;
    }
};

Explaination:
There is a basic formula to find nth term of an arithmetic progression. an=a1+(n-1)d where an is the nth term ,d is the common difference between two terms in the AP and n is the no of term we want to find.
So using above formula , calculate the nth term after finding d=(a2-a1) and return an.
