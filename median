Question:
Given an array arr[] of N integers, calculate the median.In case of even number of elements, average of two middle elements is the median.

Solution:
class Solution
{
    public int find_median(int[] v)
    {
        // Code here
        int n=v.length;
        Arrays.sort(v);
        if(n%2!=0)
        return v[n/2];
        else
        {
            return (v[n/2]+v[(n/2)-1])/2;
        }
    }
}

Explaination:
Median is the mid value in a set of numbers.Here we are given an array , so we need to sort the array elements either in ascending or descending order to find the median.
Variable n is declared to store the length of given array v[].
Using default function "Arrays.sort(v)" I sorted the array and using "v.length" array length is calculated.
If n is an odd number which means no of elements are odd then we have to returnv[n/2] as the median is the mid element of array.
If n is an even number ,we have to   return (v[n/2]+v[(n/2)-1])/2 as instructed in the question to return the average value of two middle elements.
