Question:
Given an integer N, find the number of divisors of N that are divisible by 3.
 
Solution:
class Solution
{
	public:
		int count_divisors(int n)
		{
		    int c=0;
		   for(int i=1;i<=n;i++)
		   {
		       if(n%i==0 &&i%3==0)
		       c++;
		   }
		   return c;
		}
};

Explaiantion:
Declare a variable for counting number of divisors which are divisible by 3.
In a fro loop, using if condition, check if the number is divisor of n or not and also check if divisor is divisible by 3. If both conditions are satisfied, increment count.
return c.
