Queston:
Write a program to find the sum of the given series 1+2+3+ . . . . . .(N terms) 
Solution:
class Solution {
  public:
    long long seriesSum(int n) {
        // code her
     long long s=n;
        return (s*(s+1))/2;
    }
};
Explaination:
Formula for sum of n numbers is (n*(n+1))/2.
As the data type of input 'n' is integer, I declared an other variable 's' of data type long long to be able to return the output fro larger numbers.
Using the above fromula I returned the sum of the numbers.
