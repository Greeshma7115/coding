Question:
You are given an integer N, reverse the digits of given number N, ensuring that the reversed number has no leading zeroes. Return the resulting reversed number.

Solution:
class Solution
{
    public long reverse_digit(long n)
    {
        long r,c=0;
        long res=0;
        while(n>0)
        {
            r=n%10;
            res=res*10+r;
            n=n/10;
        }
        return res;
    }
}

Explaination:
Declare the required varaibles of data type long as input is of type long and initialize them.
Use a while loop until n>0 to find the reverse of the number.
In the while loop, find the remainder of n using mod 10. To find reverse number, "res=res*10+r" where r is remainder and res is result.
Divide n by 10 and return res.
